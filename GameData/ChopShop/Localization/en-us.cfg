And to make their leave less sad we have build in some fireworks, which are also used as retro-rockets. (If you don't want fireworks for some reason - empty the solid fuel amount before launch).
	#LOC_ChopShop_LeadWeight_Title = Lead Counterweight
	#LOC_ChopShop_LeadWeight_Desc = Dumb cheap piece of lead, bolted on side of your vehicle to counter weight of all that antennas, radars, sensors and other equipment.
