// Shinies! Unfortunately you MUST install Textures Unlimited mod to see parts as they WERE INTENDED TO BE SEEN - with metallic shader.

// I tried "SSTU/PBR/MetallicTransparent" for "Glass" and "Bottle" items, but couldn't make it look nice. Either write me, or directly commit to ChopShop on GitHub if you manage to achieve some nice shiny result with it.
