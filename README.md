# ChopShop
Here should be one more place for Dr. Jet's ChopShop. I can't find another way to achieve exotic localizaions other than merge some other people commits (which GitHub is quite good for).
Also will dump Unity Packages with all part sources here (to satisfy the requirements of GNU license). Poke me when you want those updated.
