# ChopShop/Source

It's a Unity package with all (I hope) part sources. Since some parts weren't updated since KSP 0.23 and Unity 4, some scenes with ready-to-export parts can be missing and even when they exist there still can be problems with animations.
Though you have it all in exact same state as I do.
